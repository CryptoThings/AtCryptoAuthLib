    The main purpose of it is to keep hardware specifics from bleeding into the higher levels - hardware specifics could include
    things like framework specific items (ASF SERCOM) vs a non-Atmel I2C library constant that defines an I2C port.   But I2C has
    roughly the same parameters regardless of architecture and framework.  I2C
